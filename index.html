        <p>At Revive Church we believe in the power of worship. Just like David, when he played the harp there was deliverance. When Peter worshiped and prayed when he was encarcirated, 
            his and the church's worship caused an angel to deliver him. We belive that through worship the prescense of God becomes tangible. We believe also that worship heals. God ihibits 
            in the praises of His people. We are a generation hungry for His prescense. We need more of His glory.
            <blockquote>Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. Psalms 95:1</blockquote>
